# Hello World
##### Short explanation overviewing the contents of the project in the repository. This would then be followed by installation steps or any other setup someone would need to do to run the project on their machine. This commonly includes notes about APIs and dependencies that were used and may not be expected to exist on all other computers. In an ideal world, someone reading your README.md would be able to come away from it with two things. First, they should have a clear understanding of what the code in the repository does, at an overview level. Second, they should know the steps they need to take to run this code on their machine. You don't need to tell them to install an IDE or teach them how to use a CLI, but you should note if you used a created environment or are providing a requirements.txt file that they should use to create their own environment.
